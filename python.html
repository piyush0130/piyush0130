    <h1>Python (programming language)</h1>
    <p><strong>Python </strong>is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
    <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2</p>
    <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.</p>
    <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>


<p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[70] and metaobjects).[71] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[72][73] and logic programming.</p>
<p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[75] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

    Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[76] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
    <ul>Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as
        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
        <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
        <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
        <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
        <li>Readability counts.</li>
    </ul>
